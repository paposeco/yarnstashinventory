# Yarn stash inventory

This is my implementation of an Inventory Application for The Odin Project. It's live at: https://yarnstashinventory-production.up.railway.app/inventory

It was an interesting project and I feel like I now know a bit more about nodejs. I implemented the extra credit features: upload images and prevent others
from editing the existing inventory without a password.

Tried tailwind for the first time and I enjoyed using it. 

As usual, the theme of my inventory is yarn because that's what I know.
